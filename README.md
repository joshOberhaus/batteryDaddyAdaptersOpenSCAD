# BatteryDaddy Adapters

Parametric OpenSCAD adapters for using smaller batteries inside larger battery holders.

- **Purpose:** Provide ready-to-use adapter models to hold coin cells and small cylindrical batteries inside D/C/AA holders.
- **Quick start:** Open the desired `.scad` file in OpenSCAD, adjust the top-level parameters, render, and export an STL for printing.
- **Example:** Quick demo below - it is my hope that the parameters themselves are self-explanatory.
